# SliPi
Hardware accelerated slideshow for the Raspberry Pi using the Pi3d library.

SliPi was designed to provide a robust solution to running a slideshow info display off
of a Raspberry Pi. This project uses the Pi3d library and shaders included in the pi3d demo library.
Together with this python 3 project a series of slides will continuously display. Screen size,
fade time and more are configurable by using config.yaml (Example included as EXAMPLE_config.yaml).
